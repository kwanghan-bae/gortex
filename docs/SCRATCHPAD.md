# 📝 System 2 Scratchpad

## 🎯 Current Goal: Neural Distillation & Autonomous Learning - COMPLETED



**Status Analysis:**

- `core/llm/distiller.py`: New engine for wisdom distillation and dataset preparation implemented.

- `agents/analyst/__init__.py`: NeuralDistiller integrated into the self-evolution routine.

- `tests/test_distiller.py`: Verified distillation logic and dataset curation.



**Outcomes:**

1.  **Wisdom Consolidation**: Multiple experience rules are now "distilled" into high-level Super Rules, reducing prompt noise.

2.  **Training Readiness**: Gortex now curates its own training datasets (`training_jobs/`) from successful self-healing events.

3.  **Continuous Intelligence**: The system autonomously refines its own "Mental Model" over time.



**Verification Results:**

- `tests/test_distiller.py`: Passed (Distillation & Curation).

- `tests/test_guardian_cycle.py`: Passed (Proactive Healing).
