# Gortex v1.0: Synaptic Orchestration System

> **"The Digital Brain"**
> Gortex is a local operating system-level AI partner designed for **Vibe Coding**. It doesn't just run code; it evolves, learns from your feedback, and actively scouts for new technologies.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
1.  **Dual-Key Resilience:** Rotates Gemini API keys to bypass rate limits.
2.  **Evolutionary Memory:** Remembers your preferences (Constraints) to avoid nagging.
3.  **Active Intelligence:** Daily scanning for new LLM models and agent patterns via `TrendScout`.
4.  **Synaptic Orchestration:** Hierarchical multi-agent system powered by LangGraph.
